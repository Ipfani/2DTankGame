# 2DTankGame
The project is about a Tank2D game, created using Love2D Lua programming language.

I created this project to learn the basics of lua programming languages.

<br/>**Implementations**
There is a an Array of enemies where each enemy is spawn from. Currently i have not added the projectiles for firing.
The user can depletes enemy lifes by crushing onto them (I will add projectiles soon).
